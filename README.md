# Supervised-machine-learning-algorithms-to-optimize-the-Ultimate-Tensile-Strength-of-friction-stir-we
In this study, two supervised machine learning algorithms i.e. supervised machine learning regression and supervised machine learning classification model have been used for predicting the Ultimate Tensile Strength (MPa) and Weld joint efficiency of Friction Stir Welded joint. The results showed that Polynomial regression model yields better result than other supervised machine learning regression model and Decision Tree (Both Gini Index and Information Gain criterion), Artificial Neural Network classification models gave better classification result than K-Nearest Neighbor classification model.
